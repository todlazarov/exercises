# Write a method that takes a string as argument. The method should return the all-caps version of the string, 
# only if the string is longer than 10 characters. Example: change "hello world" to "HELLO WORLD".
# (Hint: Ruby's String class has a few methods that would be helpful. Check the Ruby Docs!)

def caps(str)
  if str.length > 10
    str.upcase
  else
    str
  end
end

puts ("Hello")
puts caps("Hello world")
